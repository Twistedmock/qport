# qport

A fast, passive port scanner using Shodan InternetDB API. This tool efficiently scans large lists of hosts to discover open ports without active scanning, making it ideal for reconnaissance and security assessments.

## Features

- üöÄ **High Performance**: Asynchronous scanning with configurable concurrency (minimum 500)
- üîç **Passive Scanning**: Uses Shodan InternetDB API for non-intrusive port discovery
- üìä **Smart Concurrency**: Automatically calculates optimal concurrency based on target list size
- üõ†Ô∏è **Flexible Input**: Supports host lists in text files (one host per line)
- üìù **Structured Output**: Clean output format with host:port pairs
- üîß **System Optimization**: Automatically configures system limits for optimal performance
- üìà **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates during scanning

## Requirements

- Rust 1.70+ (for building from source)
- Internet connection (for Shodan API access)
- Linux or macOS (system optimization features)

## Installation

### Option 1: Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Twistedmock/qport.git
cd qport

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at target/release/qport
```

### Option 2: Direct Download

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Twistedmock/qport/releases) page.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan hosts from a file
./qport -i hosts.txt -o results.txt

# Scan with custom concurrency
./qport -i hosts.txt -o results.txt -c 1000

# Enable verbose output
./qport -i hosts.txt -o results.txt -v
```

### Command Line Options

```
Usage: qport [OPTIONS] --input <INPUT> --output <OUTPUT>

Options:
  -i, --input <INPUT>        Input file with list of hosts (one per line)
  -o, --output <OUTPUT>      Output file for results
  -c, --concurrency <CONCURRENCY>
                              Number of concurrent requests (auto-calculated based on input if not specified, minimum 500)
  -v, --verbose              Enable verbose output
  -h, --help                 Print help
  -V, --version              Print version
```

### Input File Format

Create a text file with one host per line:

```
example.com
192.168.1.1
scanme.nmap.org
subdomain.example.org
```

### Output Format

Results are saved in the format `host:port`:

```
example.com:80
example.com:443
192.168.1.1:22
192.168.1.1:80
scanme.nmap.org:22
scanme.nmap.org:80
```

## Concurrency

qport automatically calculates optimal concurrency based on your target list:

- **Formula**: `max(hosts √ó 0.6 √∑ 60, 500)`
- **Minimum**: 500 concurrent requests
- **Maximum**: Calculated based on target list size (no hard cap)

### Examples:
- 10,000 hosts ‚Üí ~500 concurrency
- 100,000 hosts ‚Üí ~1,000 concurrency
- 1,000,000 hosts ‚Üí ~10,000 concurrency

You can override the auto-calculated value with the `-c` flag, but it will be increased to the minimum of 500 if lower.

## System Requirements

### Linux
The tool automatically configures optimal system settings:
- File descriptor limit: 1,048,576
- TCP settings optimized for high concurrency

### macOS
File descriptor limits are optimized automatically. For maximum performance, you may need to run:
```bash
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=2097152
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=1048576
```

## API Rate Limits

qport uses the free Shodan InternetDB API, which has rate limits. For large-scale scanning:
- Space out your scans to avoid hitting rate limits
- Consider using multiple IP addresses if needed
- The tool handles API errors gracefully and continues scanning

## Examples

### Basic Scan
```bash
./qport -i targets.txt -o open_ports.txt
```

### Large-Scale Scan with Custom Concurrency
```bash
./qport -i large_target_list.txt -o results.txt -c 2000 -v
```

### Quick Test
```bash
echo "scanme.nmap.org" > test.txt
./qport -i test.txt -o test_results.txt -v
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to set file descriptor limit"**
   - On Linux: Run with `sudo` or adjust system limits
   - On macOS: The tool will still work but with reduced performance

2. **High memory usage**
   - Reduce concurrency with `-c` flag
   - Process smaller batches of targets

3. **Slow scanning**
   - Check your internet connection
   - You may be hitting Shodan API rate limits
   - Try reducing concurrency

### Verbose Mode

Use the `-v` flag for detailed output including:
- API query URLs
- Error messages for individual hosts
- System configuration status
- Concurrency warnings
